# Simple Auto Scroll

### 1. What is it?

A speed-customizable auto-scroll Google Chrome extension.

### 2. Why?

A lot of times I find myself reading long
[textfiles](http://www.textfiles.com/), and after a while, I kind of
wish I could just read them as if they were a movie. I've tried with
the mouse (middle click) thingy, but it's just not practical and
adjusting the speed is very tricky - not to mention that a lot of
times it's just too fast.

## 3. Features

This extension allows you to easily change the auto-scroll speed and
save it in three different modes; slow, medium and fast. A single
click will stop the auto-scrolling.

### 4. Installing

**Option 1** just install it from the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dccjkemhmffnljlnnoffljpkhkfpldff)

**Option 2** â€“ install it from source:

* clone/download this repo,
* open Chrome and go to `chrome://chrome/extensions/`,
* enable "Developer mode",
* click "Load unpacked extension",
* select the `extension` folder in this repo.

### 5. Compatibility

It works on all Chrome distribution channels: Stable, Beta and Dev.
